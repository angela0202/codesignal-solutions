Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered *lucky* if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

Given a ticket number `n`, determine if it's *lucky* or not.

__Example__

* For `n = 1230`, the output should be
`isLucky(n) = true`;
* For `n = 239017`, the output should be
`isLucky(n) = false`.
